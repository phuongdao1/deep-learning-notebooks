Here are a couple of deep learning projects that I have implemented. The implementations are in Jupyter notebooks and can be displayed on browser.

+ Visualization in deep neural networks (nn_visualization): I implemented two techniques for visualizing which parts/pixels of the images affecting the output class probabilities of digits in MNIST dataset.

+ Utilizing multiple GPUs for training CNN network on MINIST dataset (mnist_on_multiple_gpu)

+ Generating synthesis images based on Generative Adversial Network (GAN) on MNIST dataset and a dataset on celebrity faces. This is based on Udacity Deep Learning assignment.

+ English to French translator (language-translation) based on learning around 140k translated sentences : This is based on Udacity Deep Learning assignment utilizing RNN seq2seq model.  

+ Sentiment analysis using RNN (sentiment-rnn): implementing two layers RNN model for predicting the sentiment of reviews.
